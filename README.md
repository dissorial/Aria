# Aria

Aria is a music player built using JavaScript, React, Redux, RapidAPI, and TailwindCSS. The project allows users to play songs, search for songs or artists, view artist details and song details, get top artist songs, or songs related to the one that is currently playing.

The project makes use of [Shazam Core API](https://rapidapi.com/tipsters/api/shazam-core) to access the music data, TailwindCSS for styling, and Redux for state management. Overall, Aria is a fully functional (although small-scale) music player that offers a similar experience as other music platforms.
